{"match3":["Name: Chroma Shift\n\nKey Variation: Rotating Rows and Columns\n\nConcept: In Chroma Shift, each move doesn’t just swap two adjacent tiles—players can rotate an entire row or column by one space. This rotation mechanic replaces the standard “swap” action.\n\nGameplay Impact:\nYou can align multiple potential matches in a single rotation, creating larger combos and chain reactions.\nStrategically deciding which row or column to rotate becomes crucial, as you might trigger multiple matches across the board.\n\nOutcome: Puts a new puzzle-like layer on top of Match 3 fundamentals, appealing to players who enjoy more controlled, strategic board manipulation."]}
