  "orig_doc": "Title: Retro Match 3 Puzzle (Deduced Original)\n\nOverview:\nA tile-matching puzzle game built on a 10x10 grid where players swap adjacent tiles to form horizontal or vertical matches of three or more identical tiles. Clearing matched tiles increases the score, and chain reactions can trigger special power-ups. The game is designed with a limited number of moves per level and includes animations for swaps, tile clears (“fade”), and falling new tiles to fill empty spaces.\n\nCore Gameplay Mechanics:\n• Grid-based Match 3: The game features a 10×10 grid filled with 6 types of colored tiles.\n• Tile Swap: Players select a tile and swap it with an adjacent tile (either horizontally or vertically). If the swap creates a match (three or more identical tiles in a row or column), the match is cleared from the board.\n• Match Detection: Both horizontal and vertical matches of at least three identical tiles are detected. Matches award points (typically 10 points per cleared tile) and may trigger chain reactions.\n• Special Blocks:\n  – Bomb Block (B): Created by matching exactly 4 tiles. When activated, it clears the surrounding 8 tiles.\n  – Lightning Block (L): Created by matching exactly 5 tiles. Activating it will clear up to 9 tiles of the same color.\n  – Firecracker Block (F): Created by matching 6 or more tiles. It clears all tiles in the same row and column.\n• Animations & Effects: \n  – Swap animations animate the movement between two swapped adjacent tiles.\n  – Fade animation is used for clearing matched tiles.\n  – Fall animations fill empty board positions with new, randomly generated tiles.\n• Scoring & Moves: A HUD displays the current score, moves remaining (default around 30 moves), and high score. Moves decrement when a valid match is made; if no match occurs, the tiles swap back.\n\nUser Interface & Technical Setup:\n• The game integrates multiple screens: Start Menu, Settings, Instructions, Game, and Game Over.\n• The HTML5 Canvas is used to render the grid and animations.\n• Audio elements provide background music and sound effects for gameplay interactions.\n• The code includes platform API stubs for retrieving high scores, volume settings, and difficulty preferences.\n\nControls & Interaction:\n• For mouse input: Players click and drag between adjacent tiles to perform swaps.\n• For touch devices: Similar swipe gestures register a swap between adjacent tiles.\n• Additional buttons provide access to settings, instructions, in-game menus, and restarting the game.",

  "modified_doc": "==============================================================\nGame Title: Chroma Shift\n==============================================================\n\nOverview:\nChroma Shift reimagines the classic Match 3 puzzle formula by replacing the conventional adjacent tile swap with a unique row and column rotation mechanic. Set on a vibrant 10×10 board populated with colored tiles, players strategically rotate entire rows or columns by one space to create matches, trigger combos, and generate chain reactions. Enhanced with updated animations and refined controls, Chroma Shift caters to players who enjoy an extra layer of strategy and puzzle-solving depth.\n\nGenre:\nPuzzle / Match 3 with strategic board manipulation\n\nPlatform:\nHTML5 Canvas (browser-based), with touch and mouse controls\n\n==============================================================\nCore Gameplay Mechanics & Features:\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n1. Board & Tile Mechanics:\n  • The game board consists of a 10×10 grid filled with 6 distinct colored tiles.\n  • Each tile is represented by its color and may be imbued with a special property (Bomb, Lightning, or Firecracker) when created via large matches.\n  • New tiles fall into place, filling empty positions after matches are cleared.\n\n2. Rotation Mechanic (Key Variation):\n  • Instead of swapping adjacent tiles, players select an entire row or column and rotate it by one space.\n  • Rotation Direction: Players can rotate a chosen row left/right or a column up/down. This mechanic is designed to facilitate multiple simultaneous matches by shifting several tiles at once.\n  • Strategic Impact: Rotating a row or column may create several match opportunities and chain reactions, adding a new layer of planning compared to traditional swap puzzles.\n\n3. Match Detection & Clearing:\n  • Matches are defined as three or more adjacent tiles of the same color aligned horizontally or vertically.\n  • Once a rotation creates one or more valid matches, the matched tiles are cleared.\n  • Score Calculation: Points are awarded based on the number of tiles cleared (typically 10 points per tile). Larger combos multiply the score.\n  • Chain Reactions: Clearing matches may allow new matches from falling tiles, triggering additional clears.\n\n4. Special Blocks & Power-ups:\n  • Bomb Block (B): Formed by matching exactly 4 tiles. On activation, clears the 8 adjacent tiles.\n  • Lightning Block (L): Formed by matching exactly 5 tiles. When triggered, removes up to 9 similar colored tiles.\n  • Firecracker Block (F): Formed by matching 6 or more tiles. Clearing this tile removes all tiles in its entire row and column.\n  • Special tiles are generated during match processing and can be activated either during a rotation or when they become part of a match.\n\n==============================================================\nControls & Player Interactions:\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n1. Row/Column Rotation:\n  • Selection: Players tap/click on a row or column indicator (or drag over the board edge) to select which line to rotate.\n  • Gesture/Buttons:\n   – For touch devices: Swipe left/right for rows or swipe up/down for columns.\n   – For mouse/desktop: Click on rotation buttons (or use drag gestures along row/column boundaries) to trigger the rotation.\n  • Visual Feedback: The selected row or column highlights, and a rotation animation smoothly shifts the tiles by one space.\n\n2. Additional Interactions:\n  • HUD displays current score, moves remaining, and high score.\n  • Dedicated UI buttons provide access to settings, instructions, in-game menus, and restarting the game.\n  • Audio cues (background music and sound effects) enhance the gaming experience.\n\n==============================================================\nLevel Design & Progression:\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n• The game consists of continuous levels where each level is played with a fixed number of moves (default of 30, adjustable via difficulty settings).\n• Objectives: Reach a target score within the move limit or achieve high score combos.\n• Dynamic Board Updates: Following each rotation, the game checks for matches, processes clears, fills empty spaces, and may trigger chain reactions.\n• Difficulty Scaling: Advanced levels may decrease moves allowed or introduce board conditions that require more strategic rotations.\n\n==============================================================\nObjectives, Scoring, and Win/Loss Conditions:\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n• Objectives:\n  – Achieve the highest possible score by forming large combos and chain reactions through strategic rotations.\n  – Complete the level’s target score before exhausting all available moves.\n• Scoring:\n  – Points per cleared tile and additional points for chain reactions.\n  – Special tile activations add bonus points.\n• Win/Loss Conditions:\n  – The game ends when the player runs out of moves.\n  – High scores are recorded and displayed on the game-over screen.\n\n==============================================================\nGame Rules & Balance Adjustments:\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n• Each rotation counts as one move. Players must plan rotations carefully to maximize matches and combos.\n• If a rotation does not result in any valid match, the board remains unchanged aside from the rotation animation, and a move is still deducted.\n• Special tiles add depth to strategy; their placements are determined from match sizes and are integrated after rotations trigger larger than standard matches.\n• Ongoing evaluations ensure that match detection remains accurate following the rotation mechanic, requiring adjustments to the animation and grid-update logic.\n\n==============================================================\nTechnical Implementation Notes:\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n• Framework: HTML5 Canvas with JavaScript, employing object-oriented principles to manage UI, game logic, and animations.\n• Animation:\n  – Updated animations include:\n   • Rotation Animation: Smooth transition that rotates an entire row or column by one tile.\n   • Modified fade and fall animations to accommodate the new rotation mechanics.\n• Adaptation:\n  – The original swap-based mechanism from the provided code is reworked into a rotation-based mechanic. Input events and animation logic are adjusted to handle row/column shifts.\n• Controls:\n  – Both touch and mouse inputs are supported with enhanced event listeners for detecting row/column selection.\n• Audio:\n  – Sound effects for rotations, match clearing, and special power-up activations are integrated.\n• Persistence:\n  – High scores and settings (like volume) are managed via local storage through a simplified Platform API.\n\n==============================================================\nSummary:\nChroma Shift innovates on the classic Match 3 puzzle game by introducing a rotation mechanic that challenges players to think in terms of entire row and column movements rather than simple adjacent swaps. This strategic twist, combined with dynamic match detection, chain reactions, and special power-ups, creates a novel and engaging puzzle experience. The game is implementation-ready for further development based on the outlined design document.",
